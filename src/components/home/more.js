          Abortion stigma is defined as a set of attitudes and beliefs, either
          conscious or unconscious, that abortion is bad, shameful, or wrong
          within a given community and therefore, women who had abortion or who
          seek abortion are stigmatized as well as healthcare providers
          associated with abortion. At the end of the day, women remain with no
          choices and denied their fundamental human right.
